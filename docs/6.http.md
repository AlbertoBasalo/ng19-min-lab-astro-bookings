# Angular 19 Tutorial - Part 6: HTTP

## Provide HttpClient

In order to use the HttpClient, we need to provide it in the application configuration.

```typescript
export const appConfig: ApplicationConfig = {
  providers: [provideHttpClient()],
};
```

The we can inject the HttpClient in our services; and perform requests.

```typescript
export class LaunchesRepository {
  http = inject(HttpClient);
  launchesUrl = `${environment.apiUrl}/launches`;
  getAll$ = () => this.http.get<LaunchDto[]>(this.launchesUrl);
}
```

## RxResource

We should use signal to present the data, error and loading state. To do so, we can use the rxResource function, that takes an observable and returns an structure with the data, error and loading state.

```typescript
export class LaunchesPage {
  launchesRepository = inject(LaunchesRepository);
  launchesResource: ResourceRef<LaunchDto[]> = rxResource(
    { loader: this.launchesRepository.getAll$ }
  );
  launches = computed(() => this.launchesResource.value() ?? []);
  errorMessage = computed(() => this.launchesResource.error() || 'Unknown error');
  isLoading = computed(() => this.launchesResource.status() === 2);
}
```

## Request loader

More often, we need to perform requests when another signal changes. We can reactively do this using the request property of the rxResource function.

```typescript
export class LaunchDetailsPage {
  launchesRepository = inject(LaunchesRepository);
  id = input.required<string>();
  launchResource = rxResource({
    request: ()=> this.id(),
    loader: (param) => this.launchesRepository.getById$(param.request)
  })
}
```

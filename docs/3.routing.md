# Angular 19 Tutorial - Part 3: Routing

## Eager route


### Generate the pages
Generate the `HomePage` component using the following command:

```bash
ng g c routes/home --type=page
```

It is an special component with type suffix `Page`.
The component is placed on the `routes` folder for easy navigation. The folder could be named as `pages` or `views` as well. But it is recommended to differentiate those components from the rest of the application components.

### Configure the routes

The routes configuration is placed on the `app.routes.ts` file.

```typescript
import { Routes } from '@angular/router';
import { HomePage } from './routes/home/home.page';

export const routes: Routes = [
  {
    path: '',
    component: HomePage,
  },
];
```

### The router outlet

To display the `AboutPage` component, we'll add (or keep if already present) a `router-outlet` directive to the `AppComponent` template.

```html
<lab-header />
<router-outlet />
<lab-footer />
```

## Lazy routes

To avoid importing every component on the `app.routes.ts` file, we can use lazy routes. Otherwise, they will increase the initial load time of the application, because every imported code is packed on the main js bundle.

### Generate the pages

Generate the `AboutPage` component using the following command:

```bash
ng g c routes/about --type=page
```
In order to facilitate its use, we'll export the class as `default`.

### Configure the routes

The routes configuration is placed on the `app.routes.ts` file.

```typescript
{
  path: 'about',
  loadComponent: () => import('./routes/about/about.page'),
}
```

The `loadComponent` is a function that returns a `Promise` of the component to load. The `import()` function is used to dynamically import the component at runtime. The Angular build process will bundle the component and its dependencies into a single js file, improving the performance and reducing the initial load time.

### Add links to the routes

To navigate to the `AboutPage`, we'll add a link to the `HeaderComponent`. Just change the anchor element substituting the `href` attribute for `routerLink` directive:

```html
<a routerLink="/about">About</a>
```

Just remember to import the `RouterLink` directive to the component imports array.

### More samples

```bash
ng g c routes/auth/login --type=page
ng g c routes/auth/register --type=page
```

Add the following routes to the `app.routes.ts` file:

```typescript
{
  path: 'auth/login',
  loadComponent: () => import('./routes/auth/login/login.page'),
},
{
  path: 'auth/register',
  loadComponent: () => import('./routes/auth/register/register.page'),
},
```

Add a router link to the `HeaderComponent` template:

```html
<a routerLink="/auth/login">Login</a>
```

And add another one to the `LoginPage` template with an absolute path:

```html
<a routerLink="/auth/register">Register if you don't have an account</a>
```
Or a relative path:

```html
<a routerLink="../register">Register if you don't have an account</a>
```

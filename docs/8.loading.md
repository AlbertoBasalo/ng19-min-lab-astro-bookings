# Angular 19 Tutorial - Part 8: Speed

## Defer
Any non-critical content can be deferred to load later. Specifically, we can defer things that may not be never used.

```typescript
@defer (when isLoggedIn()) {
  <lab-book-seats-form 
    [launch]="launch()" 
    [rocket]="rocket()" 
    [(seats)]="bookSeats" 
    (bookNow)="book()"
  />
} 
```

## Cache
The fastest call is the one that is not made. We can cache the result of any HTTP call with interceptors.

```typescript
const cache = new Map<string, HttpResponse<any>>();

export const cacheInterceptor: HttpInterceptorFn = (req, next) => {
  if (req.method !== 'GET') return next(req);
  const cachedResponse: HttpResponse<any> | undefined = cache.get(req.url);
  if (cachedResponse) return of(cachedResponse);
  return next(req).pipe(
    tap((event) => {
      if (event instanceof HttpResponse) {
        cache.set(req.url, event);
      }
    })
  );
};
```

This interceptor needs to be added to the providers of the application.
```typescript
{
  providers: [
    provideHttpClient(  
      withInterceptors([cacheInterceptor])
    ),	
  ],
}	
```

## Zoneless

Generate your own zone-less app from the beginning.

```shell
ng new advent-2024 --experimental-zoneless
```
Or add the provider while configuring the project.

```typescript
{
  providers: [
    provideExperimentalZonelessChangeDetection(),
  ],
}	
```

In any case you use a clean polyfill at your angular.json file.

```json
  "polyfills": [],
```

And remove the zone from the dependencies list.

```shell
npm uninstall zonejs
```
